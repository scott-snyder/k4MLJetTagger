/**
 * @class JetObsWriter
 * @brief This class is a Gaudi algorithm for writing jet observables that are used for tagging to a TTree.
 *
 * The algorithm follows the Gaudi framework's lifecycle, with the initialize() method being called at the start,
 * execute() method being called for each event, and finalize() method being called at the end. The algorithm also
 * provides methods for initializing and cleaning the TTree.
 *
 * The execute function loops over all jets in the events and retrieves the observables for tagging with the
 * JetObservablesRetriever. It then dumps all the information into a TTree. The output root file can be used for
 * training a neural network for jet tagging.
 *
 * @note The naming convention for the observables follows the key4hep implementation (see Structs.h and for the
 * conversion to the old FCCAnalyses convention Helpers.cpp).
